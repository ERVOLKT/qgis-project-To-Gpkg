# qgis-project-To-Gpkg
simple plugin to transfer all vector  layers within one qgis project to one Geopackage.

Sometimes it is handy to have all relevant layers of one project exported to one place, no matter if they exist in one place in the current project.  
Thus you can transfer all the data in a concise way. Afterwards, you can transfer all of the styles for a leaner project.
